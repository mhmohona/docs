## Introduction

TODO

## Purpose

TODO

## Who should use this guide

**UPDATE THIS**

The audience for this guide is WCF developers, development leads, and architects who are interested in migrating WCF solutions on .NET 4 and earlier to ASP.NET Core 3.0 using gRPC services.

## How you can use this guide

**UPDATE THIS**

This is a short introduction to building gRPC Services in ASP.NET Core 3.0 with particular reference to WCF as an analogous platform. It explains the principles of gRPC, relating each concept to the equivalent features of WCF, and offers guidance for migrating an existing WCF application to gRPC. It is also useful for developers who have experience of WCF and are looking to learn gRPC to build new services. The sample application can be used as a template or reference for your own projects, and you are free to copy and reuse code from the book or its samples.

Feel free to forward this guide to your team to help ensure a common understanding of these considerations and opportunities. Having everybody working from a common set of terminology and underlying principles helps ensure consistent application of architectural patterns and practices.
