# WCF System Requirements

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a communication infrastructure that is used to create distributed applications. The following lists the requirements that enable WCF to run.

## System Requirements

WCF is installed by default on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../includes/wv-md.md)].

WCF can also be installed on [!INCLUDE[wxpsp2](../../../includes/wxpsp2-md.md)], Windows Server 2003 R2, or [!INCLUDE[ws2003sp1](../../../includes/ws2003sp1-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The Message Queuing (MSMQ) functionality of WCF is supported only on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../includes/wv-md.md)], Windows Server 2003 R2, [!INCLUDE[ws2003sp1](../../../includes/ws2003sp1-md.md)], and Windows XP Professional.
