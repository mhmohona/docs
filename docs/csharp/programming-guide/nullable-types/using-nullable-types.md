# Using nullable value types (C# Programming Guide)

Nullable value types are types that represent all the values of an underlying value type `T`, and an additional [null](../../language-reference/keywords/null.md) value. For more information, see the [Nullable value types](index.md) topic.

> [!NOTE]
> C# 8.0 introduces the nullable reference types feature. For more information, see [Nullable reference types](../../nullable-references.md). The nullable value types are available starting with C# 2.

You can refer to a nullable value type in any of the following interchangeable forms: `Nullable<T>` or `T?`. `T` must be a value type.

## Declaration and assignment

As a value type can be implicitly converted to the corresponding nullable value type, you assign a value to a nullable type as you would for its underlying value type. You also can assign the `null` value. For example:

[!code-csharp[declare and assign](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#1)]

## Examination of a nullable type value

Use the following readonly properties to examine an instance of a nullable value type for null and retrieve a value of an underlying type:

- <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> indicates whether an instance of a nullable type has a value of its underlying type.

- <xref:System.Nullable%601.Value%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> gets the value of an underlying type if <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> is `true`. If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> is `false`, the <xref:System.Nullable%601.Value%2A> property throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.

The code in the following example uses the `HasValue` property to test whether the variable contains a value before displaying it:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use HasValue](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#2)]

You also can compare a variable of a nullable value type with `null` instead of using the `HasValue` property, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use comparison with null](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#3)]

Beginning with C# 7.0, you can use [pattern matching](../../pattern-matching.md) to both examine and get a value of a nullable value type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use pattern matching](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#4)]

## Conversion from a nullable value type to an underlying type

If you need to assign a value of a nullable value type to a non-nullable type, use the [null-coalescing operator `??`](../../language-reference/operators/null-coalescing-operator.md) to specify the value to be assigned if a value of a nullable value type is null (you also can use the <xref:System.Nullable%601.GetValueOrDefault(%600)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to do that):

[!code-csharp-interactive[?? operator](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#5)]

Use the <xref:System.Nullable%601.GetValueOrDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType> method if the value to be used when a value of a nullable value type is `null` should be the default value of the underlying value type.

You can explicitly cast a nullable value type to a non-nullable type. For example:

[!code-csharp[explicit cast](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#6)]

At run time, if the value of a nullable value type is `null`, the explicit cast throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.

A non-nullable value type is implicitly converted to the corresponding nullable type.

## Operators

The predefined unary and binary operators and any user-defined operators that exist for value types may also be used by corresponding nullable types. These operators produce `null` if one or both operands are `null`; otherwise, the operator uses the contained values to calculate the result. For example:

[!code-csharp[operators](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#7)]

> [!NOTE]
> For the `bool?` type, the predefined `&` and `|` operators don't follow the rules described in this section: the result of an operator evaluation can be non-null even if one of the operands is `null`. For more information, see the [Nullable Boolean logical operators](../../language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators.md#nullable-boolean-logical-operators) section of the [Boolean logical operators](../../language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators.md) article.
  
For the relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), if one or both operands are `null`, the result is `false`. Do not assume that because a particular comparison (for example, `<=`) returns `false`, the opposite comparison (`>`) returns `true`. The following example shows that 10 is

- neither greater than or equal to `null`,
- nor less than `null`.

[!code-csharp-interactive[relational and equality operators](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#8)]

The above example also shows that an equality comparison of two nullable value types that are both null evaluates to `true`.

For more information, see the [Lifted operators](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#lifted-operators) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).

## Boxing and unboxing

A nullable value type is [boxed](../types/boxing-and-unboxing.md) by the following rules:

- If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> returns `false`, the null reference is produced.
- If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> returns `true`, a value of the underlying value type `T` is boxed, not the instance of <xref:System.Nullable%601>.

You can unbox the boxed value type to the corresponding nullable type, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[boxing and unboxing](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/NullableTypesUsage.cs#9)]
