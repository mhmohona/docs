# Prerequisites for .NET Core on macOS

This article shows you the supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies that you need to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines. The supported OS versions and dependencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the [command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link).

## Visual Studio for Mac

You can use any editor to develop .NET Core applications using the .NET Core SDK. However, if you want to develop .NET Core applications on a Mac in an integrated development environment, you can use [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link).
